- Hi, my name is Pavel Buryak. 
- I'm a frontend-developer.


## About
My goal is to achieve great success in IT, develop my skills and become better. To achieve this - I have to work a lot. I am sure that I will succeed, because I self-confident, confident in my abilities and I am hardworking. I like what I do, I learn quickly, I adapt quickly, but even if I have some problems, Iâ€™m never afraid to ask others, communication in a team has never been difficult for me. I am a sociable, purposeful and responsive person. I believe sometimes it is necessary to work more than others to achieve really high results, every day to become better than you were yesterday, learn something new, doubt the old, adapt to new conditions and also to sacrifice time and money. But all this justifies itself when you look back and see that you have become better. In my opinion, I am the capable young man who is ready to challenges, improve and move forward. I am sure that there will be many difficulties on my way, but difficulties will make me better, and I will cope with them. Study hard and you will be rewarded!
